**Author**: Marcos Roberto Benso  
**Date**: June 30, 2025

This R-based toolkit provides a reproducible workflow for analyzing the accuracy of different Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) using a variety of statistical metrics and visualizations. It supports automated comparison of DEM products against a reference elevation model.
